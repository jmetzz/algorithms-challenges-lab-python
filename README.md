# Algorithm and data structures challenges (in Python)

My sandbox and playground for algorithm implementation and CS challenges.

Be aware that most of the code is not complete and might not even compile.


# Run the examples

If you are using VS Code, make sure to add the correct configuration.
It is important the set the `PYTHONPATH` variable correctly in order to 
get the `imports` working properly.
Therefor, replace `/path/to/` part of the path with the correct path 
where the code base is located.

```json
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "env": {
                "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/algorithms-challenges-lab-python/src:/path/to/algorithms-challenges-lab-python/resources"
            },
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]

```

Alternativelly, you can set the path inside the running script. For example:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys; print('Python %s on %s' % (sys.version, sys.platform))
    sys.path.extend(['/path/to/algorithms-challenges-lab'])
    // ...
```
