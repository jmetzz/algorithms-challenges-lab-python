"""Consider a checkerboard with n × n squares and a cost function c(i, j)
which returns a cost associated with square (i,j) (i being the row, j being
the column). Let us say there was a checker that could start at any square on
the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path
(the sum of the minimum costs at each visited rank) to get to the last rank;
assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right
forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on (1,3) can move to (2,2),
(2,3) or (2,4).

For instance (on a 5 × 5 checkerboard),

| 6	7	4	7	8 |
| 7	6	1	1	4 |
| 3	5	7	8	2 |
| –	6	7	0	– |
| –	–	*5*	–	– |


This problem is expressed by the following recursion:

for j < 1 or j > n:     q(i, j) = ∞
for i = 1:              q(i, j) = c(i, j)
otherwise:              q(i, j) = min( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)
