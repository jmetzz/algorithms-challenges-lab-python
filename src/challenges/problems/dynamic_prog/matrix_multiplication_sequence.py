    the indexes such that a separation is add at index k.

        s =
        [[-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1]
        [-1 -1  1  1  3  3  3]

    The first split for the chain [1, 6] happens at k=3.

        A1 A2 A3 | A4 A5 A6

    The next step, when considering [1, 3] (which is A1 A2 A3),
    we then spli at s[1, 3] = 1. Thus, k = 1:

        A1 | A2 A3
    And so on repeating the process until finished.

    The base case for the recursion is when i and j are equal, meaning
